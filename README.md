# PLANE MOD FOR THE LONG DARK
![](https://github.com/SamimiesGames/tld-plane-mod/tree/master/Assets/Plane_V1_IG.png)
### Enjoy the scenery of Great Bear from the birdseye view! Deliver crucial supplies quickly across the island! 

## HOW THE MOD WORKS
When hit the edge of the map the aircraft and all 
its passengers will travel to the region that would be the way you travel.


#### WHERE TO FIND PLANES
- Planes can be found in a couple places on great bear.
    * Forsaken Airfield (WHEN NOT DOWNGRADED TO z_perilousconstraint)
    * Pleasant Valley

#### HOW TO FLY
- COMING SOON

#### HOW THE PLANES FLY
- Engine Speed (RPM) controls the engine power of the aircraft
- The engine power is used to add speed to the aircraft
- If the climb angle is too high the plane stalls
- If the fuel level dips below 25% your engine starts to slowdown
- If the altitude is more than the max altitude of the plane your engine slows down
